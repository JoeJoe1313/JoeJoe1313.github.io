Lissajous (/ˈlɪsəʒuː/) curves or also Lissajous figures or even Bowditch curves are the family of curves described by the following parametric equations

$$
x(t)	=	A \cos{\left(\omega_x t - \delta_x\right)} \\
y(t)	=	B \cos{\left(\omega_y t - \delta_y\right)}
$$

sometimes also written in the form

$$
x(t)	=	a \sin{\left(\omega t + \delta\right)} \\
y(t)	=	b \sin{t}.
$$

Lissajous curves find applications in physics, astronomy, and other sciences.
